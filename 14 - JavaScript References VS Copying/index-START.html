    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const players2 = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //players2[3] = 'Sam';

   // console.log(players);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players3 = players.slice();
    const players4 = [].concat(players)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players5 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    players[3] = 'Sam'
    console.log(players)
    console.log(players2)
    console.log(players3)
    console.log(players4)
    console.log(players5)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const copy = Object.assign({}, person, {date: 30-12-1996})

    console.log(person)
    console.log(copy)

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const copy2 = {...person}

    console.log(copy2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
